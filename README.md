## Description:

Greetings!

This **Multimedia Player** is an HTML workshop offered by freeCodeCamp. 

The goal of this project is to build an HTML-based multimedia content page that supports audio, video, and transcript elements in an inclusive, accessible format. The page structure is organized around semantic section elements, each serving a distinct roleâ€”song playback, video demonstration, and transcript presentation.


This project demonstrates a commitment to digital accessibility by incorporating semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, alternative text, and structured media support. By meeting these requirements, the page ensures that all users, including those with auditory, visual, or cognitive impairments, can engage with the content effectively.
